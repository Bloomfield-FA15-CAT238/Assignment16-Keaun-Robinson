This tutorial was about making a fractal, in this case a 3d, complex, mesh made of smaller elements; said smaller elements are the larger shape itself.
I chose this because this was part of a larger tutorial on perlin nose functions, which is essiental for procedural generation. This can be applied to textures as well as larger 3d meshes.
